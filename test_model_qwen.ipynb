    "# Fine-Tuning Qwen-Chat Large Language Model (Multiple GPUs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tongyi Qianwen is a large language model developed by Alibaba Cloud based on the Transformer architecture, trained on an extensive set of pre-training data. The pre-training data is diverse and covers a wide range, including a large amount of internet text, specialized books, code, etc. In addition, an AI assistant called Qwen-Chat has been created based on the pre-trained model using alignment mechanism.\n",

LLMs are typically trained on large amounts of text data, such as books, articles, and web pages, and are able to learn and improve over time through reinforcement learning.\n",

They can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks, from generating summaries of long documents to generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses to user queries.\n",

Ability to handle complex tasks: LLMs are capable of handling a wide range of tasks, from generating summaries of long documents to generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses to user queries.
